## Project Description
The Attendance Management System is a simple Python-based console application that allows a user to record and display student attendance. The system enables the user to enter student names, mark attendance as Present or Absent, and generate an attendance report.

This project was developed following the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The Attendance Management System was developed using the **Waterfall Model** of the Software Development Life Cycle.

### 1. Requirement Analysis
The goal of the system is to provide a simple way to record and manage student attendance.
The system requirements include:
- Recording student attendance by date
- Storing student ID and name
- Searching attendance by student ID
- Calculating attendance percentage
- Saving attendance records to a file

### 2. System Design
The system is designed as a console-based Python application.
- Student data is stored using dictionaries
- Attendance records are stored using date-based keys
- A menu-driven interface controls system operations

### 3. Implementation
The system is implemented using Python.
- Functions are used to modularize the system
- Conditional statements handle attendance logic
- The datetime module is used to capture attendance dates
- File handling is used to store attendance records persistently

### 4. Testing
The system was tested using various input scenarios:
- Valid student ID and attendance inputs
- Searching for existing and non-existing student IDs
- Calculating attendance percentage correctly
All tests produced expected results.

### 5. Deployment
The system is deployed by running the Python script locally using a terminal in Visual Studio Code.

### 6. Maintenance
Future maintenance and improvements may include:
- Exporting attendance data to CSV
- Adding a graphical user interface
- Improving input validation
